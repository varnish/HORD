//! [`HordListener`]: the server runtime topology for embedding HORD under a
//! work-stealing host runtime — the Carapace integration's "Blocker 0".
//!
//! ## The problem it solves
//!
//! [`AsyncHordStream`] is `!Send` by construction: its registered buffers hold
//! raw pointers and the completion queue is polled from the thread that built it
//! (see the crate-root docs). A host that accepts on a multi-threaded runtime and
//! drives each connection with `tokio::spawn` therefore **cannot** hand a HORD
//! stream to its per-connection service — `tokio::spawn` requires `Send`. The
//! thread-affinity is intrinsic (it is how the CQ is driven), not an accident, so
//! the fix cannot live in the host: HORD must own the runtime topology.
//!
//! ## The topology
//!
//! `HordListener` owns it end to end — **thread-per-core**:
//!
//! - One **acceptor** thread runs a current-thread runtime, parks on the
//!   listener's CM-channel fd, and round-robins each accepted (still-`Send`)
//!   [`Connection`](hord_stream::Connection) to a worker over a channel.
//! - **N worker** threads (one per core by default), each a current-thread
//!   runtime + [`tokio::task::LocalSet`] — its own completion domain. A worker
//!   builds the `!Send` [`AsyncHordStream`] on its own thread (so the stream never
//!   crosses a thread) and `spawn_local`s the host's service future for it. One
//!   worker thus drives *many* connections concurrently on one core, each parked
//!   on its own CQ fd via that runtime's reactor (the 1:1 model; the N:1
//!   completion-channel demux is a later fd-economy optimization, not needed here).
//!
//! The host supplies a per-connection service as a closure
//! `FnMut(`[`AsyncHordStream`]`, SocketAddr) -> impl Future` — a `!Send`-friendly
//! `serve_conn`. The closure (and the futures it returns) never leave the worker
//! thread, so nothing it touches need be `Send`. The closure *itself* must be
//! `Send + Clone` only so a copy can be handed to each worker thread.
//!
//! ```no_run
//! # async fn doc() {
//! use hord_async::HordListener;
//! use hord_stream::HordConfig;
//!
//! let (_tx, shutdown) = tokio::sync::watch::channel(false);
//! let listener = HordListener::bind("0.0.0.0", 4791, HordConfig::default())
//!     .expect("bind");
//! listener
//!     .serve(shutdown, |stream, peer| async move {
//!         // Drive `stream` (an `AsyncHordStream`: AsyncRead + AsyncWrite) here —
//!         // e.g. `hyper::server::conn::http1::Builder::new().serve_connection(...)`.
//!         // Wrap it in a `SharedAsyncStream` first if the handler needs to reach
//!         // the connection for a zero-copy RDMA write.
//!         let _ = (stream, peer);
//!     })
//!     .await;
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Graceful shutdown
//!
//! [`serve`](HordListener::serve) takes a [`tokio::sync::watch::Receiver<bool>`]
//! (pingora's `ShutdownWatch` *is* one, so it can be passed straight through; no
//! coupling to pingora types). When the value flips to `true` — or the sender is
//! dropped — the acceptor stops accepting, the worker channels close, and each
//! worker lets its in-flight connection tasks finish before exiting, bounded by
//! [`grace_timeout`](HordListener::grace_timeout). `serve` resolves once every
//! worker has drained, so a host `async fn` can `.await` it as the end of its
//! own shutdown sequence.
//!
//! HORD owns *stopping the accept loop and bounding the drain*. The host owns its
//! own **per-connection** graceful drain: a keep-alive connection sitting idle
//! between requests is blocked inside the service future (waiting for the next
//! request) and will not return until the client closes or the grace timeout
//! elapses. To wind such connections down promptly, capture your own clone of the
//! shutdown receiver in the service closure and drive your HTTP layer's graceful
//! shutdown with it (e.g. `hyper_util`'s `GracefulShutdown`) — exactly as the
//! host would on a `TcpStream`. HORD's grace timeout is the backstop, not the
//! mechanism.
//!
//! ## Properties the byte-stream parity relies on (Milestone 1)
//!
//! Two properties of [`AsyncHordStream`] make `hyper` keep-alive and the host's
//! body backpressure behave exactly as on TCP; both are exercised by
//! `tests/listener.rs`:
//!
//! - **Keep-alive EOF.** [`AsyncRead`](tokio::io::AsyncRead) returns `Ok(0)` only
//!   on a *real* peer half-close — never between pipelined requests on one QP — so
//!   `hyper`'s keep-alive loop serves N requests over one connection and a host's
//!   promote-on-clean-EOF logic sees EOF only when the peer actually closed.
//! - **`poll_write` backpressure.** When the credit window is exhausted,
//!   [`poll_write`](tokio::io::AsyncWrite::poll_write) returns `Poll::Pending`
//!   (it parks on the completion fd) rather than buffering unbounded and returning
//!   `Ready`. A slow RDMA reader therefore back-pressures the writer, so a host
//!   streaming a cache body through a bounded channel cannot be made to pull an
//!   arbitrarily large object fully into RAM.
//!
//! ## Caveat: synchronous handshake on the worker
//!
//! A worker completes the HORD handshake synchronously inside
//! [`AsyncHordStream::from_accepted`] (a brief CQ busy-poll for one round trip),
//! which momentarily pins that worker — and so its other connections — until it
//! returns. Acceptable here because the handshake is one fast exchange; a
//! latency-sensitive deployment would move it off the worker (a dedicated
//! handshake stage, or an async handshake) so a slow-handshaking peer cannot
//! stall a worker's other connections. The seam to do so is local to the worker
//! loop.
