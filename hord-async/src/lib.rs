//! Async HORD stream: [`tokio::io::AsyncRead`] + [`tokio::io::AsyncWrite`] over
//! a [`hord_stream::HordStream`], so `hyper` (or any tokio byte-stream consumer)
//! can run over RDMA unmodified.
//!
//! ## How it drives the NIC
//!
//! The synchronous stream busy-polls the completion queue (100% CPU while
//! blocked). Here we instead wait on the CQ's completion-channel fd via
//! [`tokio::io::unix::AsyncFd`]: arm the CQ, park the task on the fd, and only
//! drain completions when the kernel signals one. That is the whole of review
//! item #15 — a blocked connection now costs nothing.
//!
//! The credit / control-lane state machine is *not* reimplemented: this type
//! calls the same non-blocking primitives the synchronous facade does
//! ([`try_read`](hord_stream::HordStream::try_read),
//! [`try_write`](hord_stream::HordStream::try_write), …) and supplies a reactor
//! in place of the busy-poll loop.
//!
//! ## Thread affinity
//!
//! [`HordStream`] is `!Send` (its registered buffers hold raw pointers), so an
//! `AsyncHordStream` is pinned to the thread that built it. A server therefore
//! accepts on one thread (producing the `Send`
//! [`Connection`](hord_stream::Connection)) and builds + runs each stream on the
//! thread that will drive it — see [`AsyncHordStream::from_accepted`].
//!
//! ## Driver model
//!
//! The stream is meant to be driven by a **single task** — one state machine
//! that reads and writes in turn. That is exactly how `hyper` drives a
//! connection (read the request, write the response), so it is the case that
//! matters. Splitting the stream with [`tokio::io::split`] and driving the read
//! and write halves from two *independent* tasks is **not** supported: both
//! halves would wait on the one completion-channel fd, and a single completion
//! stream carries events for both directions, so waking the correct half would
//! need a multi-waiter scheme this prototype does not implement. Concurrent
//! bidirectional traffic from one task (the busy-poll path's
//! `full_duplex_bulk`) is fine; two tasks over `split` can stall.
//!
//! ## Zero-copy (spec §7)
//!
//! The one-sided RDMA write is driven through [`SharedAsyncStream`], a clonable
//! handle that lets a `hyper` server reach the connection from inside its request
//! handler — necessary because the write shares the one completion queue `hyper`
//! drains, on the one driving task. The client needs no handle: it registers its
//! destination buffer up front ([`AsyncHordStream::register_remote_writable`])
//! and reads it after the response. The `X-HORD-RDMA-Write` HTTP semantics live
//! in `hord-zerocopy`.
//!
//! ## Timeouts
//!
//! Per-operation deadlines are applied the idiomatic tokio way — wrap a call in
//! [`tokio::time::timeout`] — rather than baked into the stream. Combined with
//! the now-tunable CM retry params (`hord_stream::HordConfig::cm`), a
//! stalled-but-alive peer no longer hangs a reader forever (review item #11). A
//! cancelled (timed-out) read/write future drops cleanly: already-reaped
//! completions stay reaped and no slot is leaked.
