# HORD prototype — TODO

- [ ] **§7.5 GPUDirect** — untestable on this host (no GPU / real NIC); the
      addr/rkey path is opaque, so it should work unchanged on capable hardware.

## Deferred from the Pass 7 (§7.7) code review

Surfaced by the high-effort review of the protocol-splitting work and consciously
deferred — none is a live bug on the supported single-task path. Context kept so a
future pass has what it needs.

- [ ] **Multi-WR split write (> `WRITE_WR_MAX` = 1 GiB) can skip the immediate.** The
      immediate rides only the final WR (`begin_rdma_write_inner`); if a *non-final*
      chunk's `ibv_post_send` fails mid-batch, the call returns `Err` having never
      posted the imm-bearing WR, so the peer's recv WR is never consumed and no
      data-plane completion is delivered. Both paths now recover via connection
      teardown — the async client via `peer_closed` → close, and the sync path too now
      that it has half-close detection (the sync half-close item above is done), so a
      sync data-plane consumer's `poll_completed_transfer` returns `None` instead of
      hanging. **Remaining (optional):** the narrower fix of surfacing an *error-bearing*
      completion on a partial-post failure rather than relying on teardown. Narrow
      (needs a > 1 GiB object *and* a mid-batch post failure).

- [ ] **Data-plane completion queue has no backpressure.** A `RecvRdmaWithImm`
      reposts its recv WR immediately (spec §7.7.5 *requires* this) and pushes the id
      onto an unbounded `completed_transfers` `VecDeque`, so a client that pipelines
      many split requests and drains slowly accumulates queued ids without the
      transport throttling it (unlike stream data, which holds its recv buffer until
      `read()`). Bounded by the client's own outstanding requests; entries are 4
      bytes. **Note:** cannot be fixed at the transport layer without violating the
      §7.7.5 "repost immediately" rule — any cap belongs to the data-plane consumer
      API, not the stream. Captured for awareness, likely WONTFIX at this layer.

- [ ] **Minor cleanup (low priority).** The `pattern()` LCG test helper still lives in
      three crates — `hord-core/tests/rdma_write_smoke.rs`,
      `hord-zerocopy/tests/split_http_smoke.rs`, and two `#[cfg(test)]` unit-test modules
      in `hord-stream/src/stream.rs`. The `hord-async` copies are now consolidated in
      `hord-async/tests/common` (a shared integration-test module). DRYing the rest is
      genuinely cross-crate: integration tests can't share code across crates and the
      `hord-stream` copies are in-`src` unit tests no `tests/common` can reach, so the
      only fix is a shared dev-only crate — over-engineering for a 7-line fn, deferred.
      (Left as-is by design: the `begin_rdma_write`/`rdma_write_all`
      `_with_imm`/`_inner` wrapper trios and the C `hord_post_write`/`_with_imm` pair —
      named methods read better at call sites than threading an `Option<u32>`.)
